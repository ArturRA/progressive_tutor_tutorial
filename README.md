# ProgressiveTutor

This is a project developed as a prototype for my bachelor's thesis where it's function is to help the learning process of IT related tecnologies. The way it does that is by having a simple and modular approach where one can use the baseline structure provided to make tutorials with the content that already exist, but is scattered across the internet, gathering it all in a single place to help save of the users of the modules created with this project.

As a proff of concept a simple note taking application was created in two different ways, as a website and a desktop application.

[Website version](https://github.com/ArturRA/progressive_tutor_multiplataform)
[Desktop version](https://github.com/ArturRA/NoteKeeperTCC)
[API and database for the Desktop version](https://github.com/ArturRA/progressive_tutor_strapi_Desktop_Mobile)

For instructions on how to create modules and how the project works it's possible to consult the thesis papers [here](https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/248711)

As create T3 app was used to make the initial setup of this project i also left bellow the original about that comes with the CLI command in case of any doubts of how to deploy the project.







# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.
